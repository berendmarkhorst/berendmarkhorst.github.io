About me
------
I am a PhD candidate working with [Dr. Joost Berkhout](https://www.joostberkhout.nl), [Dr. Ir. Jeroen Pruyn](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.f.j.pruyn/) and [Prof. Dr. Rob van der Mei](https://www.few.vu.nl/~mei/) at the Stochastics department of CWI. I obtained my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, specializing in Optimization of Business Processes. My research interests are centered around operations research, stochastic programming, and mathematical optimization. Currently, I focus on applying mathematical optimization to robust, effective, and adaptable ship design.
