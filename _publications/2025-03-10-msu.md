excerpt: 'This study examines the optimal placement of a Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU) in the greater Oslo area to maximize patient coverage and improve stroke treatment times. Using historical stroke data and a mathematical optimization model based on the Maximum Coverage Location Problem (MCLP), we identified the best MSU base location. Our findings suggest that optimal placement could increase patient coverage by 17%, and a rendezvous approach could further boost coverage by 300% for confirmed stroke cases. Additionally, the MSU could reduce time to thrombolysis by 27 minutes (25%) and time to thrombectomy by 35 minutes (20%). The study highlights the value of geospatial analysis in strategic MSU deployment to enhance prehospital stroke care and patient outcomes.'
